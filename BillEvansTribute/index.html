		<h2 id="timelineheader">A brief timeline of Bill Evans' life:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>1929</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Bill Evans was born on 16 August 1929 to Harry and Mary Evans. He was two years younger than his brother Harry, with whom he maintained a very cordial relationship.
 
			<li><strong>1934</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;At the age of six, he began his piano lessons along with his elder brother at Somerville, and also studied violin, piccolo and flute which had a deep impact on his keyboard style. Later, he went to take piano lessons in Dunellen with a local teacher Helen Leland.
			<li><strong>1946</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;In September 1946, he enrolled himself at Southeastern Louisiana University on a flute scholarship, where he received a comprehensive knowledge of classical piano interpretation. He also led the fraternity’s football team to a league championship as a quartet.
			<li><strong>1949</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Bill Evans had composed his first tune, ‘Very Early’ and was a founding member of American collegiate musical fraternity, ‘Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia’. Soon after, he formed his first trio with his friends, Connie Atkinson on bass and Frank Robell on drums, and played in clubs in New Jersey.
			<li><strong>1950</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Bill Evans graduated with high honors as a piano major receiving the Bachelor’s degree in music education. He performed Beethoven’s piano concert number 3 for his senior recital. In the same year, he formed a trio with guitarist Mundell Lowe and bassist Red Mitchell, and relocated to New York. However, low bookings forced them to leave for Calumet city, Illinois.
			<li><strong>1954</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Bill Evans went back to New York after serving three years in the US Army, and started playing in Tony Scott’s quartet. In the same year, he undertook postgraduate studies at Mannes College of music.
			<li><strong>1956</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;In September 1956, he recorded his debut album, New Jazz Conceptions, featuring the original versions of "Waltz for Debby", and "Five". New Jazz Conceptions was initially a failure as it sold only 800 copies in the first year but received critical success.
			<li><strong>1958</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;In April 1958, he embarked on an eight-month gig with the Miles Davis’s sextet. Soon he made his first studio album, ‘Jazz Track’ with Davis but he left the sextet by November, as he became tired of high expectations. In December, he released the album ‘Everybody digs Bill Evans’ with Sam Jones and Philly Joe Jones, for which he received great attention.
			Sometime during the late 1950s, most probably before joining Miles Davis, Evans began using heroin. Philly Joe Jones has been cited as an especially bad influence in this aspect. Although Davis seems to have tried to help Evans kick his addiction, he did not succeed.
				<li><strong>Peri's Scope</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;he had his first long-term romance with a black woman Peri Cousins. (for whom Peri's Scope was named)It lasted until the end of the decade when they parted ways.
			<li><strong>1959</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;By the fall of 1959, he formed a trio with Scott LaFaro on bass and Paul Motian on drums. It became one of the most acclaimed piano trios and soon they recorded their first album ‘Portrait in Jazz’.
			<li><strong>1961</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;In 1961, three albums were produced in a short span of time including ‘Explorations’, Oliver Nelson’s ‘The blues and the abstract truth’, ‘Sunday at the village vanguard’ and ‘Waltz for Debby'. The last two albums were the live recordings and are considered to be the greatest jazz recordings of all time.
			<li><strong>Scott Lafaro's death</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;In June 1961, Evans went into seclusion for almost a year because of the untimely death of Scott LaFaro in a car accident. He re-emerged the following spring with new bassist Chuck Israelis and released ‘Nirvana’ with Herbie Mann and his trio. Soon ‘Undercurrent’ followed in which he collaborated with Jazz guitarist Jim Hall.
			<li><strong>Ellaine Schultz</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; By the turn of the decade, Bill met waitress named, Ellaine with whom he was in a relationship for twelve years.While the couple was never married, Ellaine was in all sense, Bill's everything. 
			<li><strong>1962</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; After re-forming his trio, Bill Evans released two albums ‘Moon Beams’ and ‘How My Heart Sings!’ In the same year, upon signing with Verve, he recorded ‘Conversations with Myself’, which was an instant classic for the Jazz community.
			<li><strong>1971</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Bill Evans released ‘The Bill Evans Album’. Soon, other albums followed namely, ‘The Tokyo Concert’ (1973), ‘Since we Met’ (1974), ‘But Beautiful’ (1974). After Mart Morell left, Evans and Gomez recorded two duo albums, ‘Intuition’ and ‘Monteux II’.
		  <li><strong>1973</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;While working, Evans met and fell in love with Nenette Zazzara. When Evans broke the news to Ellaine, she pretended to understand, but then committed suicide by throwing herself under a subway train. Evans's relatives believe that Ellaine's infertility, coupled with Bill's desire to have a son, may have influenced those events, Nenette Bill Evans married Nenette Zazzara and after two years of their marriage, they were blessed with a son, Evan. The new family also included Evan’s step-daughter Maxine but the marriage did not last - they remained quite close until his death.
		 <li><strong>1974</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;In 1974, he recorded a jazz masterpiece entitled ‘Symbiosis’, which was written for him by Claus Ogerman. He also collaborated with singer Tony Bennett on ‘The Tony Bennett and "Bill Evans Album’ (1975) and ‘Together Again’ (1977).
		<li><strong>1979</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;April 1979, he met a Canadian waitress Laurie Verchomim with whom he had a relationship until his death. She was 28 years younger than him.
		<li><strong>Harry Evan's death</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;in the spring of 1979, Evans learned that his brother, Harry, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, had committed suicide at age 52.This news shocked him deeply, and some of the concerts had to be canceled. 
Following the year in August,  Evans recorded his last studio album, We Will Meet Again, featuring a composition of the same name written for his brother.
			<li><strong>1980</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;On September 15, 1980, Evans, who had been in bed for several days with stomach pains at his home in Fort Lee, was accompanied by Joe LaBarbera and Verchomin to the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, where he died that afternoon.[47] The cause of death was a combination of peptic ulcer, cirrhosis, bronchial pneumonia, and untreated hepatitis.[10] Evans's friend Gene Lees described Evans's struggle with drugs as "the longest suicide in history."He was interred in Baton Rouge, next to his brother Harry.
